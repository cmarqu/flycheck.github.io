## Tooling ##

This website is a static website build with [Jekyll][] on Github Pages.  The
pages and posts are written with Markdown.  The Flycheck manual is written with
[Texinfo][], the standard documentation format for Emacs.

## Style and fonts ##

This site uses the Adobe Source family of fonts:

* [Adobe Source Serif Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-serif-pro)
  (body text)

The CSS is custom, with much inspiration and help by the great book

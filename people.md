## Teams ##

### Maintainers ###

* **[Sebastian Wiesner](https://github.com/lunaryorn)** (head maintainer)
* [Clément Pit--Claudel](https://github.com/cpitclaudel) (maintainer)

They maintain Flycheck and all official extensions within the
[Flycheck organisation](https://github.com/flycheck), and set the direction, and
scope Flycheck.  They also accept or decline pull requests and feature
proposals, implement changes and fix bugs in Flycheck.

### Moderators ###

Our moderators help uphold our [Code of Conduct][coc].  We do not currently have
a dedicated moderation team; all our [Maintainers](#maintainers) are also
moderators throughout our Github organisation and in our official communication
channels.

## Acknowledgements ##

We would also like to thank the following people and projects:

* [Bozhidar Batsov](https://github.com/bbatsov) for his valuable feedback and
  his constant support and endorsement of Flycheck from the very
  beginning. Notably he added Flycheck to his popular
  [Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude) project at a very early stage
  and thus brought Flycheck to many new users.
* [Magnar Sveen](https://github.com/magnars) for his
  [dash.el](https://github.com/magnars/dash.el) and
  [s.el](https://github.com/magnars/s.el) libraries, which support considerable
  parts of Flycheck internals, and greatly helped to overcome the
  [Sebastian’s](https://github.com/lunaryorn) initial aversion to Emacs Lisp.
* [Martin Grenfell](https://github.com/scrooloose) for the Vim syntax checking
  extension [Syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic), which saved
  [Sebastian’s](https://github.com/lunaryorn) life back when he was using Vim,
  and served as inspiration for Flycheck and many of its syntax checkers.
* [Matthias Güdemann](https://github.com/mgudemann), for his invaluable work on
  Flycheck’s logo.
* Pavel Kobyakov for his work on GNU Flymake, which is a great work on
  its own, despite its flaws and weaknesses.
* [Simon Carter](https://github.com/bbbscarter), for his patient in-depth
  testing of automatic syntax checking, and his very constructive feedback.
* [Steve Purcell](https://github.com/purcell) for his valuable feedback, the
  fruitful discussions and his important ideas about the shape and design of
  Flycheck, and his indispensible and dedicated work on MELPA, which drives the
  continuous distribution of Flycheck to its users.
* [Sylvain Benner](https://github.com/syl20bnr) for the awesomeness that is
  Spacemacs.

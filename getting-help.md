Documentation
=============

Flycheck comes with with a [comprehensive manual][manual].  You can read this
manual in Emacs `M-x flycheck-info`, provided that you already installed
Flycheck.  The latest manual is also [available online][manual].

The article [Flymake versus Flycheck][1] provides a detailed comparison of
Flycheck and the older built-in Flymake extension.  If you have used Flymake or
are still using it we recommend that you take a look at this article to see how
Flycheck is an improvement over Flymake and what new features it provides.  We
hope that this article helps you to decide whether you might consider switching
to Flycheck and to learn what is new in Flycheck.

The [Changelog]({{site.baseurl}}/changes.html) lists all changes in all releases
and the development version of Flycheck.

If you think that our documentation is unclear, imprecise, factually incorrect
or could otherwise need improvement please do not hesitate to tell us, by
reporting to our [issue tracker][].

title: New Code of Conduct and Gitter chat
layout: post
---

As part of our [ongoing efforts][1] to turn Flycheck into an open and welcoming
project we now have an official [Code of Conduct][coc] which defines what we
consider acceptable and welcome behaviour within this project and aims at
creating a safe space for all our contributors regardless of religion,
ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation and similar personal traits.

Our new code of conduct is largely taken from the [Rust Code of Conduct][2],
adapted to our project structure and enhanced with some additional provisions,
notably against cursing and use of bad words which we think are undesired within
our project.

All of our contributors and all participants in our communications and
discussions are now expected to follow the new Code of Conduct; the Flycheck
maintainers will enforce it on Github and in other communication channels.

With the new Code of Conduct we also introduces a new communication channel:
Flycheck now provides an official [chatroom on Gitter][gitter].  This channel is
there for your questions, problems and suggestions!  Please join, ask your
questions and participate in our discussions.

Happy new year,
Flycheck maintainers
